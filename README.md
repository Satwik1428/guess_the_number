## 📌 Description
This mini project is designed to **practice JavaScript DOM manipulation**.  
The computer generates a **random number between 1 and 100**, and the user tries to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts.

After each guess, the application updates the UI dynamically to indicate whether the guessed number is **too high** or **too low**, making it a hands on DOM practice project.
